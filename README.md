### I'm a QA Engineer

I'm Dmitrii Marichev, an IT enthusiast hailing from Sacramento, California. But originally, I'm from Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.

Back in 2014, I proudly earned my degree in Finance and Credit from Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod (NNSU). In my younger days, I attended a lyceum with a focus on physics, mathematics, and programming.

While juggling my university studies, I dived headfirst into web development tools (HTML, CSS, JS), programming (Python), and all things IT. Fast forward a bit, and I've got several years of experience under my belt as a project manager, overseeing numerous projects from mere concepts to full-blown production.

In my downtime, you'll often find me whipping up some delectable sweet treats (pastries are my jam!). I'm also quite the sports enthusiast; tennis and running are my go-to activities. I absolutely love traveling! My favorites? Iceland, Norway, Indonesia, and the good ol' United Kingdom.
